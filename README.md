### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ifeanyi, I am a professional Data Analystics Engineer. I have keen interest in building efficient ETL pipelines, data warehouse and AI-powered data driven applications.

What I am doing at the moment...
-  Iâ€™m currently working on a smart conversational chat bot that would enable researchers to interact with research papers uploaded on arXiv.  
-  Sales Data Analysis: I used visualization to provide answers to few questions on sales data. Check it out [here](https://sales-analysis-ifeanyi-darlington.streamlit.app/).
-  Sales and Customer Dashboard: I designed and developed an interactive dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard can be viewed on [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/SalesDashboard_17257187986310/SalesDashboard?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
-  I'm interested in collaborating on projects involving data analysis, data pipeline, Natural Language Processing, and general appliation of Large Language Model. If you are working in any of these projects feel free to send me an email at ifeanyi.emeagi@gmail.com.
