### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ifeanyi, I am a full stack data scientist, interested in data science, web scraping, data engineering, data driven applications and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an educational tutor application that explicitly provide positive feedback on student's assessments.
- ðŸŒ± I used visualization to provide answers to few questions on sales data. Check it out [here](https://sales-analysis-ifeanyi-darlington.streamlit.app/).
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm interested in collaborating on projects involving web scraping, AI development, data analysis and data engineering. If you are working in these projects feel free to send me an email at ifeanyi.emeagi@gmail.com.
