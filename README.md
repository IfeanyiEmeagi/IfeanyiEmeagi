### Hi there 👋

My name is Ifeanyi, I am a full stack Data Analytics Engineer. I specialised in building production grade ETL pipelines, data warehouse and AI-powered data driven applications.

My previous works and What I am doing at the moment...
- I am building an agentic solution that would enable travellers to maximise their choices such as cost, convenience when searching for an airline.
-  Built a smart conversational chat bot that would enable researchers to interact with research papers uploaded on arXiv. This is my masters project thesis work. 
-  Sales Data Analysis: I used visualization to provide answers to few questions on sales data. Check it out [here](https://sales-analysis-ifeanyi-darlington.streamlit.app/).
-  Sales and Customer Dashboard: I designed and developed an interactive dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard can be viewed on [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/SalesDashboard_17257187986310/SalesDashboard?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
-  I'm interested in collaborating on projects involving data analysis, data pipeline, Natural Language Processing, and general appliation of Large Language Model. If you are working in any of these projects feel free to send me an email at ifeanyi.emeagi@gmail.com.
